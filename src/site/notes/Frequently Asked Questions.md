There are a lot of questions I repeatedly get about how to use certain features within Universe, technical errors, and more. I've decided to answer a few of them all in one place.

There are a lot of questions I repeatedly get about how to use certain features within Universe, technical errors, and more. I've decided to answer a few of them all in one place.

**Q: I'm not getting emails. What is the problem?**

First, make sure you have emails turned on. Some people unsubscribe accidentally. Go to your account ([click here](https://www.joshuniverse.com/?ref=joshuahabka.com#/portal/account)) and ensure emails are toggled on.

Second, check your spam and junk folders. Search "noreply@blog.joshuniverse.com" in your inbox and make sure the emails aren't going to a separate folder. If they are, be sure to mark them as important or open and reply to an email, which will teach your inbox you like us.

If neither of these work, shoot me an email at contact@joshuniverse.com with the subject line "Subscription issue" and we'll figure it out.

**Q: I want to support Universe, but I don't want to subscribe. Can I donate?**

A: Yes, you can leave a tip. Thank you!
