## What Can I Do?

1. **Login to computers with my hand** and/or arm utilizing NFC(near-field communication) and RFID(radio frequency identification). This works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
2. **Unlock doors with NFC-equipped locks**(only works on certain door systems. This is an example of the type of lock I can open: [https://www.amazon.com/ULTRALOQ-Keyless-Bluetooth-Handle-Keypad/dp/B0BPSJFXKD/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?keywords=nfc%2Bdoor%2Block&qid=1692667699&sr=8-3-spons&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/ULTRALOQ-Keyless-Bluetooth-Handle-Keypad/dp/B0BPSJFXKD/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?keywords=nfc%2Bdoor%2Block&qid=1692667699&sr=8-3-spons&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1)
3. **Generate TOTP Two Factor Authentication Codes**. This is **like Google Authenticator**, but instead, the keys to generate the one-time-passwords are stored on my subdermal electronic system. This provides the benefit of being completely offline(as it cannot be accessed from the internet, Bluetooth, etc.), being harder to lose my authentication device(if you lose your phone and you have a non-cloud authenticator app, then you lose yo ur codes). This leads to both **improved** **security** and **privacy**.
4. **Unlock Tesla Cars** utilizing their "Valet-Card" NFC compatibility. This allows me to register as a "Valet Card" and be able to unlock a Tesla without having actually to use a physical valet card.
5. **Store PGP and related encryption keys**
6. **Sign and authorize cryptocurrency transactions** and a**uthenticate a cryptocurrency wallet.**
7. **Store websites, text**, and more where others can scan and be directed to a website, networking profile, etc.
