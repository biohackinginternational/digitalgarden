**Title:** What Is The Big Rip Theory?

**Abstract:** The Big Rip Theory is where the universe matter and space-time itself is being gradually ripped apart as the Universe expands in some time in the future, until there is an infinite distance between particles.

First published in 2003, The Big Rip is a cosmological hypothesis predicting the gradual disintegration of all matter universal in the expansion of the Universe. In physical cosmology, the Big Rip is a hypothesized model of cosmology concerning the ultimate fate of the Universe, wherein universe matter, from stars and galaxies to atoms and subatomic particles, and even space-time itself, is being gradually ripped apart as the Universe expands in some time in the future, until there is an infinite distance between particles. The Big Rip cosmological model is based on the idea that if the Universe continues accelerating its expansion, the Universe will eventually reach the point at which all of the forces holding it together will be exceeded by dark energy.
That is the Big Rip -- if dark energy gets stronger and stronger over time, eventually, it will overwhelm every attractive force, and then it will rip everything to shreds. In a similar scenario, instead of simply speeding up by expanding at a steady rate, that power speeds up exponentially, ultimately tearing the fabric of reality - the end is called the Big Rip. Disconzis's hypothesis says that a Big Rip could happen when dark energy becomes stronger than gravity, reaching the point where dark energy could rip apart individual atoms.
If a Big Rip is accurate, not only is the whole cosmos expanding (which happens independently of dark energy), and not only are distant objects appearing to accelerate away from us with increasing speed as time goes by (which happens due to dark energy), objects bound together through any of the fundamental forces will ultimately be torn apart by the increasing force of dark energy. The core of the Big Rip theory has its roots in the notion of dark energy. This particular substance makes up 68% of the Universe, which has the singular effect of expanding the Universe at accelerating rates. The Big Rip is a hypothesis of the ultimate fate of the Universe, which would happen if specific properties of dark energy were proven to be correct.
Because there is no way we can ever measure anything to perfect, uncertainty-free accuracy, the best we can do is to say that if the Big Rip happens, then the Big Rip is going to happen very soon, such that by the time it happens, every structure in the Universe has already decayed. Most experts think that the mass of matter in the Universe will make it so the expansion of the Universe will slow -- and that the Universe might even shrink back down again, causing another Big Bang. A new theoretical model suggests that, as the Universe expands, everything, from galaxies, planets, and atomic particles to space-time itself, will eventually break up, then disappear out of sight.
