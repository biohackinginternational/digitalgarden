Scientists are only beginning to seriously consider the possibility of life on Titan, on or beneath its surface. Whether or not there is life on Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is an open question at this time, a subject for evaluation and scientific study. There is currently no evidence of life on Titan but its complex chemistry and unique environments make Titan a great candidate for life. The moons surface temperature of Saturn is far colder than any location on Earth that has been found with microbes, and many organisms on Earth have been revived by the frigid temperatures, leading some to speculate that, if life exists on Titan, it might be suspended in time. Steven Techtmann, an associate professor and environmental microbiologist at Michigan Technological University, said life on Saturn's moon could be radically different from life on Earth, particularly since researchers tend to assume life needs water.
Alternatively, just as the microbes lurking at Earth's polar depths, life may exist far beneath the surface of Titan. There are many possible habitats for exotic biota on Titan, Saturn's giant moon, including organisms that could either be native to Titan's surface and living in liquid hydrocarbons or originated in the subsurface ocean and have adapted to living in an aqueous environment, like an ammonia-water mix. It is plausible that Titans subsurface ocean may be providing a cornucopia of chemicals for the surface environment, dissolved in cryomagmatic fluids; these could also carry signatures of life from a subsurface ocean, or -- as with the Black Smokes of Earths ocean floors early in the past -- providing concentrated sources of nutrients to specialists living on the surface of Saturn's giant moon Titan.
First, Titan, the Saturnian moon, probably hosts a subsurface ocean of liquid water, in which Earth-style, lipid-based cells would have fared well. Specifically, some researchers suggest that life might be assembled from a specific set of chemical building blocks uniquely suitable for Titan's harsh environment. Another exciting point making Titan such an attractive research target is the possibility that molecules that might reside on Titan's surface might be identical to those that form the building blocks for life on Earth.
Suppose life is possible, which has different chemical properties from Earth. In that case, Titan might be a spot for the discovery of methane-based rather than water-based microorganisms, the existence of which is still just hypothetical. Although all living things on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid water as their solvent, life on Titan might use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane, instead.
Titan is one of the best candidates in the Solar System to harbor microbial extraterrestrial life. It is the only moon with a thick atmosphere composed primarily of nitrogen and liquid lakes on its surface made up of hydrocarbons like methane and ethane. Titan appears to have lakes of liquid ethane or methane on its surface, along with rivers and seas. Some scientific models have suggested that it may support hypothetical life not based on water. With its abundant supply of organic molecules and weather patterns similar to Earth, scientists believe Titan is among the most likely places for alien life to reside.
