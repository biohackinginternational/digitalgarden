A human microchip implant is an electronic device implanted subdermally usually via an injection with a syringe or a needle. These devices **contain no batteries** and instead communicate with compatible readers(this could be a smart phone, door lock, and such devices with RFID capability) using the small magnetic field that the reader generates. No need for chargers or batteries.

Microchip implants can do everything from unlocking your computer to paying for your groceries using contactless payment. Here is a list of common uses for RFID implants:

-   Unlocking your computer
-   Unlocking/Starting your car(Yes, this can work with Teslas)
-   Unlocking door locks
-   Sharing contact information
-   Contactless Payment
-   Two-Factor Authentication
-   Cryptocurrency Wallet Address Storage

You can also use your implant with Apple Shortcuts to do anything from turning your lights on to calling your friends. This can be done by adding the NFC implant as a trigger in the "automations" section in the Apple shortcuts app.

RFID stands for Radio-Frequency Identification. RFID technology enables the communication between an unpowered tag(the implant) and a powered reader. 

RFID systems consist of a reader with an antenna, and a transponder(this would be your implant). There are two different RFID tags possible. Either they are active, meaning they have their own power source or they are passive. Passive tags have no own power source and have to be supplied with energy via an electromagnetic field produced by the reader. A microchip implant would be an example of a passive tag.

NFC stands for Near-Field Communication. NFC is also based on the RFID protocols. The main difference to RFID is that a NFC device can act not only as a reader, but also as a tag(this allows for abilities like contactless payment).

NFC systems operate on the same frequency as HF(High Frequency) RFID (13.56 MHz) systems. Therefore, there are only short read range limitations.

The use of microchip implants in use of the human body is relatively new so there can be alot of misconceptions about new, emerging technologies like this. Here is a list of common misconceptions:

-   No, human implantable microchip implants do not come from vaccination needles.
-   There is no clear affiliation with microchip implants being a vehicle of the "Mark of The Beast" - in the book of Revelation, often associated with the religion of Christianity and Catholicism.
-   No, in the current state of implants, they do not possess tracking cellular/GPS tracking capability as they are simply too small than the smallest available trackers.

Subdermal implants are not for everyone and that is completely understandable. Here are a few things that you should take into account before proceeding with purchasing a microchip implant:

-   They can be expensive - the typical cost of purchasing and having a microchip implant installed can be a **few hundred dollars**. This is because the implants themselves often start at around $60 and installation costs can often start at around $100 for basic installation procedure by a trained and licensed professional.

There are different implant which serve different purposes; from generating two-factor authentication codes to sharing contact information. Provided is a list of the most popular implants and their prices and uses.

There are a few known retailers offering these implants and can vary based on your location. The most well-known is **Dangerous Things** by Amal Graafstra. They are based in the United States and ship globally. These are some of the current retailers:

Dangerous things is the most popular retailer and is **highly recommended** for first time buyers or anyone interested in these transponders. They have the widest selection of implants(including payment implants from **Walletmor** and digital identity implants by **Vivokey**). They offer shipping across the world and offers free shipping on most orders.

While you wait for implant to arrive, it is best to plan your installation. There are two routes you can go down: professional installation or self installation.

First, you want to find a place that is capable in safely installing your implant. The map below(Dangerous Things Professional Installation Partner Map) is the best resource to find a professional installer near you. 

Once you have found a professional near you, it is best to contact them using the information provided on the map to ask about pricing and a day to install your implant(s).

If there is no partner near you, **DO NOT JUST CALL AROUND!** Follow Dangerous Thing's [guide to approaching a professional](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/how-to-approach-a-professional) in your area.

Please be aware that not every installer can install every product. As a general rule of thumb, blue pins can install only capsule shaped implants. Red pins can install capsule implants, and flexible implants like the Walletmor and Apex flex. Yellow pins can generally install any type of publicly available implant. 

**_Self installation can be EXTREMELY dangerous if you do not know what you are doing and not skilled and confident in performing safe aseptic procedures._** However, if you are ready to proceed then it is recommended to have the following before performing a self-installation:

-   **Trusted friend** to help in the procedure
-   **Clean space** to perform the installation
-   **Single use** Antiseptic Wipes
-   **Sterile** gauze pad
-   **Expandable-fabric** adhesive bandage
-   **Non-latex** procedure gloves
-   **Clean disposable** mat or cover to place on the clean installation area

Implant kits sold through Dangerous Things and most other retailers generally supply the required installation equipment. It is always best to check the product page to see what comes with the product.

Now that we are prepared for the installation, we need to decide where to have the implant installed. If you are installing an x-series or comparable capsule-shaped implant, the **webbing between your thumb and pointer finger** is the most common installation spot and highly recommended for beginners.

![](https://blog.joshuniverse.com/content/images/2022/10/Human-Hands-Front-Back.png)

Different implants, however, are better suited for installation in other places. Flex implants(like the Walletmor and the Apex flex are better suited on locations that do not flex and move alot. **It is best to consult with a professional installer when installing an implant of this type, no matter how experienced you think you are.** Installation of Flex implants are significantly more involved than standard capsule implants and **can do some serious damage if not installed properly.**

Please refer to this guide for the location naming conventions for installing implants on the hand: [https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/naming-convention-for-implant-locations-in-the-hand/6075](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/naming-convention-for-implant-locations-in-the-hand/6075).

It is installation day which can look different depending on the path of installation you choose.

First, you will most likely be asked to check-in. Then the installer will prepare a clean workspace for installation. After that, you will asked where you would like your implant installed(if you haven't been asked when booking your procedure). Depending on your choice, you may be recommended a different area which can lead to a safer installation. After that, the procedure will begin, **see installation procedures below.** After installation you will most likely be given guidance on post-installation care to ensure your implant installation location heals properly, **see post-installation for additional tips.**

When it is time for you to begin self-installation with a trusted partner, **follow the installation procedures below depending on the implant of your choice.** 

The extremely short communications range that these small, capsule bioglass encased transponders requires the subject to be able to manipulate and position the transponder with the greatest degree and range of motion possible. The human hand, specifically the posterior (dorsal) area between the metacarpal bones of the thumb and index finger, is the ideal location for these transponders. We call this area of the hand “the triangle”, and it is ideal for the following reasons:

1.  **low risk of damaging major radial and median nerves**
2.  **low risk of damaging major blood vessels**
3.  **low risk of damaging tendons or their synovial sheaths**
4.  **plenty of soft tissue to help absorb blunt force impacts**
5.  **good distance from bones to avoid pinching and crushing**

Ultimately the transponder should rest parallel to the metacarpal bone of the index finger with **at least 5mm between bone and glass**. The **folds of the webbing also need to be avoided as mechanical stresses** in that area could cause **rejection and breakage problems.**

This hand anatomy illustration clearly indicates major **nerve bundles, blood vessels, and tendons**. It should be obvious that the **posterior section of the hand between the metacarpal bones of the thumb and index finger** is clearly the ideal location to install a capsule glass transponder with minimal risk.

The safety clip is a plastic retaining clip designed to cling to the plunger between the syringe housing and the push-top of the plunger assembly, blocking the plunger from being depressed. **Remove this clip** during equipment preparation.

![](https://blog.joshuniverse.com/content/images/2022/10/2022-10-30_11-49.png)

Find the **trapezium** and **trapezoid bones** where the metacarpal bones of the thumb and index finger meet. Next find the first **proximal interphalangeal joint** (first knuckle) of the index finger, then **halve the distance** between the bottom of that joint and the top of the carpometacarpal joint above the trapezoid bone. Using an **industry accepted safe skin marking pen**, place a small T mark over this center point above the index finger metacarpal bone such that the **top of the T runs parallel to the bone** and t**he leg runs perpendicular**, out towards the metacarpal of the thumb.

![](https://blog.joshuniverse.com/content/images/2022/10/2022-10-30_11-53.png)

**Adduct the thumb to the neutral position.** When adducted to where the thumb is sitting parallel to and firmly against the index finger, the adductor pollicis, adductor pollicis brevis, and opponens pollicis muscles will form a small hump of tissue that protrudes slightly from the posterior of the hand between the metacarpals of the index finger and thumb. The curved shape, much like a dome, should allow you to easily identify and mark the top of this area with a dot that is directly adjacent to the leg of the T mark you made early. This mark will typically denote the approximate center of the “transponder triangle”. **This is where you will want the center of the transponder to be.**

![](https://blog.joshuniverse.com/content/images/2022/10/2022-10-30_11-55.png)

Grip the skin just around the central mark and pull it up to tent it away from muscle tissue. Roll the skin to try to detect and dislodge any large blood vessels. **It is best to perform this for around 30 seconds to a minute to ensure the skin is ready for installation.**

![](https://blog.joshuniverse.com/content/images/2022/10/2022-10-30_12-00.png)

The glass transponder is usually **12-13mm long**, so you will want to pick a site that is f**ar enough forward from the central mark** to ensure there is enough space between the target location and the incision site. Also, during the healing process, **the transponder typically moves back toward the incision site anywhere from 4mm to 6mm.**

![](https://blog.joshuniverse.com/content/images/2022/10/2022-10-30_12-03.png)

As you press the needle into the skin, be sure to **keep the needle parallel to the index finger metacarpal bone** to control your horizontal alignment, and your **vertical aliment parallel with the tissues of the hand** to ensure you do not puncture dermis or muscle tissue. The transponder will need to be deposited subdermally, in the **fascia layer, no deeper.**

![](https://blog.joshuniverse.com/content/images/2022/10/2022-10-30_12-05.png)

Installation is intended for professionals only and does NOT replace professional training.

The needle makes a clean channel under the skin lifting and separating dermis from muscle tissue and creating a path through the fascia tissue for the transponder to rest in. If you do not retract the needle when depressing the plunger to deposit the glass transponder, **the transponder will force its own path through unseparated fascia**, and chances are high that this could lead to a **resting position that is not parallel to the metacarpal bone** of the index finger. **This is not an ideal resting position** for the transponder.

![](https://blog.joshuniverse.com/content/images/2022/10/2022-10-30_12-12.png)

Once the trailing needle bevel is under the skin, gently guide the needle in until you assess the needle has made it's way under the central mark. If necessary, loosen your grip on the tented skin slightly and continue to insert the needle **at least 10mm** past the central mark. Depress the plunger slowly **until you can see the glass transponder begin to come out of the needle end**. The transponder will produce a **slight protrusion** of the skin as it moves out of the needle tip and should be easily seen. Slowly continue to depress the plunger as you gently retract the needle at about the same rate. This will neatly deposit the transponder into the channel created by the needle.

Once the plunger has been fully depressed, you should feel and possibly **hear a slight click**. At this point gently remove the needle, **immediately cover the wound with sterile gauze**, and **apply pressure for 2 to 5 minutes** until **all bleeding has stopped.**

![](https://blog.joshuniverse.com/content/images/2022/10/2022-10-30_12-08.png)

Now that you have successfully installed your implant, you want to ensure the wound heals properly. **You may not be able to read or write to your transponder for at least 24 hours due to swelling.** The swelling should go down with **2-24 hours** after installation. It can take about **2-4 weeks to fully encapsulate the implant.** During this time, it is highly recommended to refrain from activities that could displace or move implants under the skin. 

After the first day, you are able to perform most **day-to-day activities** without risk of displacing your implant. **You can safely interact with water at this point**, swimming is not recommended until after a week of healing. 

Do not poke, stab, or otherwise put any pressure on the tag for the next 2-4 weeks to ensure the implant can heal properly and be encapsulated by the collagen tissue. If you wish to slightly accelerate this process you take [prenatal vitamins](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=prenatal+vitamins). 

You may also experience momentary tingling, pinching sensations, or itching at the installation site for the next 12-24 months. **This is normal**, as it indicates **your body is healing around the tag** and damaged nerves around the install site are reconnecting.
